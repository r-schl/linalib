### Lin(ear) A(lgebra) Lib(rary) 

##### This project was created on 2020-01-17. 

This library can perform linear algebra calculations used in game engines. Since it is necessary in a game engine to very often perform thousands of calculations per second, this library is built in such a way that these calculations can be performed as quickly as possible. For example, objects are only created when absolutely necessary and all operations on objects are in place.
