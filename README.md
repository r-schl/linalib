# LinALib
### Lin(ear) A(lgebra) Lib(rary) 
This library can perform linear algebra calculations used in game engines. Since it is necessary in a game engine to very often perform thousands of calculations per second, this library is built in such a way that these calculations can be performed as quickly as possible. For example, objects are only created when absolutely necessary and they can be reused. 

This library was created at 2020/01/17.
