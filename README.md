# LinALib
### Lin(ear) A(lgebra) Lib(rary) 
This library can perform linear algebra calculations used in game engines. Since it is necessary in a game engine to very often perform thousands of calculations per second, this library is built in such a way that these calculations can be performed as quickly as possible. For example, objects are only created when absolutely necessary and can be reused.
